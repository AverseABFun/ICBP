# ICBP
Internet Censorship Bypass Protocol(I don't expect anyone to use this over TOMP, but if you want to...)

The two current variants are [Version 1, Variant 1](https://github.com/AverseABFun/ICBP/blob/main/ProtocolV1.1.md) and [Version 1, Variant 2](https://github.com/AverseABFun/ICBP/blob/main/ProtocolV1.2.md). Both can somewhat easily be implemented in one server, but they haven't yet. If you create a server or client please send it to me either at [averse.abfun@gmail.com](mailto:averse.abfun@gmail.com) or as an issue on this repo.
